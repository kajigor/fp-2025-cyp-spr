1. Create  an algebraic data type for Lambda terms. 
2. Make the type the instance of `Show` and `Eq`.
3. Implement a simple substitution which does not rename anything.
4. Create a type class which captures the notion of alpha-equivalence and make your data type its instance. 

You can write your code in a single file or create a project if you already know how to. 

Please implement the `main` function which demonstrates how your functions work.
