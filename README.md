# HW05

## Deadline 23:59 2.04.2025

1. (4 points) Implement a parser for the statement language from HW04.
    * I would recommend using [megaparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec), read this [tutorial](https://markkarpov.com/tutorial/megaparsec.html) to learn how to. 
2. (2 points) Write tests. 
3. (2 points) Write a console application which asks the user a path to the file with a program in the statement language, parses it, evaluates it, and prints out the result.
